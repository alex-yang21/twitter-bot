Gungan translator rules:
  1. Try to use mappings from https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gungan_Basic
  2. Change a phrase like 'I am going' --> 'My goen'
  3. Try not to use old Gungan
  4. Use our own rules to fill in the holes

Our rules:
  1. Follow English grammar, just use 1-1 mappings. This may conflict with some Gungan grammar.
  2. Expand the Gungan vocabulary as seen fit while keeping integrity of the language
  3. Rules outside of the dictionary:
    - replace 'ing' from any verbs with 'en' for valid gerunds
    - change 'ion' to 'eon' for valid nouns
    - add 'en' to present tense verbs and nouns (subjects and direct objects) that end in good letters, not "q", 'j', 'x', etc
