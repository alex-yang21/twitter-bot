Gungan translator rules:
  1. Try to use mappings from https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Gungan_Basic
  2. Try not to use old Gungan
  3. Use our own rules to fill in the holes

Our rules:
  1. Follow English grammar, just use 1-1 mappings. This may conflict with some Gungan grammar.
  2. If there are ever exists 's a ', combine into 'sa '
  3. Expand the Gungan vocabulary as seen fit while keeping integrity of the language
  4. Rules that can require some randomization (ex: execute 30% of the time):
    - add 'a' after a word that ends in 's' (20%)
    - add 'n' after a verb/noun that ends in 'e' (20%)
    - replace 'ing' from any verbs with 'en'
    - add 'en' to verbs/nouns that end in good consonants, not 'y', 'j', 'x', etc (15%)
